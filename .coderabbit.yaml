        For Playwright system tests, make sure each test that triggers a backend mutation (e.g., clicking a save button)
        waits for a UI confirmation element that proves the request completed successfully before proceeding.
        Otherwise, the test might continue before the operation finishes.

        Also if someone navigates to a course page, and clicks continue on a dialog straight away, make sure its done with the
        `selectCourseInstanceIfPrompted` function.

        Make sure to use the `useTranslation` hook for all text that is visible to the user.

        If a component uses colors, use colors from the theme if possible. Example: import { baseTheme } from "@/shared-module/common/styles" ... background: ${baseTheme.colors.clear[100]};

        If a component uses media queries, use the respondToOrLarger function. Example: import { respondToOrLarger } from "@/shared-module/common/styles/respond" ... ${respondToOrLarger.sm} { ... }

        If component sends requests to server, use either useQuery, or useToastMutation hooks, or use hooks wrapping those hooks.

        If there is a form of any kind, make sure it uses useForm from react-hook-form, and make sure the form is integrated with the useToastMutation and useQuery hooks.

        For loading and error states, use the Spinner and ErrorBanner components from the shared module.
