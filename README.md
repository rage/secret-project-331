Secret Project 331 is a Learning Management System (LMS) developed by the MOOC Center of the University of Helsinki. It's deployed at [https://courses.mooc.fi](https://courses.mooc.fi). It includes:

- A visual, no-code course material editor based on blocks (text, media, embeds, exercises, etc.)
- Exercises are created directly within the material editor â€” no need to context-switch to a separate tool
- Multiple exercise types including multiple-choice, essay, short answer, and timelines
  - New exercise types can be added via plugins. Plugins can be developed by third parties and installed without changes to the core system
- Automatic progress tracking, pass/fail logic, and certificate generation
- Built-in glossary, citation manager, course statistics, and inline student feedback tools
- Support for multilingual courses
- Integration with the Open University of the University of Helsinki for official completion registration

> [!NOTE]
> The system builds on years of dedicated work on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Helsinki.
> It was developed by a team led by [Henrik Nygren](https://github.com/nygrenh), who also designed the core features and software architecture.

## Development Environment Setup

To begin development on Secret Project 331, set up your local environment by following the instructions in [Development.md](./docs/Development.md), which covers setup on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Code Style

In this project, code style is enforced with automatic tools. To ensure your contributions follow the project's code style, you need to set up pre-commit hooks and configure your editor.

### Setting Up Pre-Commit Hooks

Run `npm ci` in the repository root to install the necessary tools:

```bash
$ cd Code/secret-project-331/
$ npm ci
```

This will install `lint-staged`, which ensures that your code passes some basic code style checks before committing.

When you're ready to perform a comprehensive code style check (note: this may take some time), use:

```bash
bin/git-run-branch-ready-checks
```

### Configuring Your Editor

#### Visual Studio Code

To configure Visual Studio Code for this project, open it in the repository root with the pre-configured workspace:

```bash
$ cd Code/secret-project-331/
$ bin/code
```

The `bin/code` command automatically opens the project with recommended settings.

After opening, install the recommended extensions prompted in the bottom right corner:

![Recommended extensions popup](./docs/img/recommended-extensions.png)

Once installed, these settings will enable your editor to:

- Automatically display code style issues.
- Automatically fix some issues when saving files.
