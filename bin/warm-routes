#
# Next.JS builds pages on demand in the development mode. Just after starting the development server this causes inconvenient compilation delays when trying to use the application. This script makes requests to some of the most common pages in the project, so that they get precompiled and can be loaded faster.
#
# This script is called automatically from skaffold.yaml after bin/dev deploys.

# Wait for the the requests to finish
# Note that skaffold would wait for the requests to finish even without this, so it's better to do this here anyway for consistency. The warm_route function is designed to return as soon as the warm up requests have started -- it does not wait for the compilation to finish to prevent this script blocking skaffold for too long.
