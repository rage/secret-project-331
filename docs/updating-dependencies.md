# Updating dependencies

Do these steps in order and commit between steps:

## Node version update

Check if we are using the current node LTS version from by comparing a `.nvmcrc` and https://nodejs.org/en/. If a newer LTS version is available do the following steps:

1. Open all `.nvmrc` files by running command: `find -name '.nvmrc' | grep --invert-match node_modules | xargs code`
2. Update all files to contain the new version number
3. Go to the root of the project and install the new version of node by running command `nvm install`
4. Open all Dockerfiles with command: `find -iname '*dockerfile' | grep --invert-match node_modules | xargs code`
5. Replace node version in the FROM statements

## Rust version update

1. Run `bin/update-rust`
2. Run command: `bin/build-dockerfile-development-base && docker push eu.gcr.io/moocfi-public/project-331-headless-lms-dev-base`
3: Run command: `bin/build-dockerfile-production-base && docker push eu.gcr.io/moocfi-public/project-331-headless-lms-production-base`

## Updating node dependencies

When updating dependencies, you need to pay special attention to the cms service. It includes the gutenberg dependency, you **must"** always read the changelog for it so that you can determine if it breaks backwards compatibility in some way. Tests won't catch all backwards incompatible changes.

Before you start: Run this: `npm ci && bin/npm-ci-all`

One by one cd to a service and run `npx npm-check --update`. Read the changelogs for breaking dependencies if necessary and select all updates. After update is done, run `npx tsc --noEmit` to catch new type errors and then commit the results. Finally, you can run `npm audit fix`.

You can get a list of targets that need updating by running: `find -name 'package.json' | grep --invert-match 'node_modules'`.

Start by upgrading the dependencies in the root of the repo and run `npm run eslint` to catch new changes to ESLint rules / prettier formatting. You can also use `npm run eslint:open:vscode` if you want to open all the files with ESLint problems.

## Update rust dependencies

Open all Cargo.toml files (`find -name 'Cargo.toml'`), and update outdated ones. If you don't see which ones are outdated in vscode install workspace recommended extensions. For prerelease crates, you have to check the latest version manually from crates.io.

Next, we will check if the code still compiles and works. Here's how to setup it correctly:

First, start `bin/dev-only-db` in one terminal. Once the database if fully up, run the following:

```bash
bin/sqlx-database-reset
bin/cargo-check
bin/cargo-clippy
bin/cargo-test
```

## Updating autogenerated types

Run the following commands in the root of the repo:

```bash
bin/extract-gutenberg-types
```

Open a different terminal in the background and open there `bin/dev-only-db`. Wait with `bin/pods` until the new postgres pod is ready before proceeding.

Then, without closing the `bin/dev-only-db`, run in another terminal:

```bash
bin/sqlx-database-reset
bin/generate-bindings
bin/generate-doc-files
```

## Testing the system

Compile the system with `bin/dev` and `bin/test`. Try to use the different parts of the applications and see if anything looks funny. Try also running the system tests. Pay special attention to the `cms` service.
