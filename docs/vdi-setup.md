# VDI Setup for MOOC Center Employees

> **Note**: This guide is intended **exclusively for employees of the MOOC Center at the University of Helsinki** who need to set up a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment for working on Secret Project 331.

This document details the setup process for the VDI environment specifically required for development on Secret Project 331.

## Ordering a VDI Desktop

1. Go to [https://onify.it.helsinki.fi/](https://onify.it.helsinki.fi/) and select **Order a virtual desktop**.
2. Choose **Basic Linux** as the desktop type.
3. Enter `vdi-mooc-<your university username>` as the name for the virtual desktop.
4. For the WBS number, please ask **redande** or **hn** in the MOOC Center Slack channel.
5. In the open text field **Describe the intended use of the virtual desktop**, you should describe that you need the virtual desktop for your work at the university's MOOC-center.
6. To receive sufficient resources and an external disk necessary for development, contact the university's helpdesk. The MOOC Center has an ongoing email thread for these requests; ask **redande** or **hn** to add your request to this thread.

## Install and Set Up Omnissa Horizon Client

1. If Omnissa Horizon Client is not already installed, download it from [VMware Horizon Client Downloads](https://customerconnect.omnissa.com/downloads/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/omnissa_horizon_clients/8).
2. Install the client software on your machine.
3. Open Omnissa Horizon Client and select **New Server**.
4. Enter `vdi.helsinki.fi` as the **Connection Server**.
5. Sign in with your university credentials. Make sure the dropdown below the credentials field is set to **ATKK**.
6. Select your virtual desktop, which should appear as `vdi-mooc-<your university username>`.

> **Tip**: You can also access the virtual desktop through [https://vdi.helsinki.fi](https://vdi.helsinki.fi), but using the VMware Horizon Client is recommended for better performance and features.

## Requesting Administrative Privileges (sudo)

Note: Before doing this step, wait until the virtual machine has been created.

Since many development tools require administrative privileges, follow these steps to request `sudo` rights:

1. Complete [this form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/42471/lomake.html) to request administrative rights.
2. For the **Identification of workstation** field, enter the name of your virtual desktop (e.g., `vdi-mooc-<your university username>`).
3. In the **Reason** field, state that you need administrative privileges to develop MOOC Center software.

## Setting Up Secret Project 331 on the Virtual Desktop

### Git and GitHub Setup

Git should already be installed on the VDI. Confirm this by running `git --version`. If it's not installed, install it with "sudo apt install git".

1. Configure your Git identity:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
   ```

   > **Privacy Tip**: If you'd like to keep your email private, follow [GitHub's guide to using a `noreply` email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).

2. **(Optional)** Install GitHub CLI to cache credentials and avoid entering your personal access token repeatedly:

   ```bash
   type -p curl >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y)
   curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
   && sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
   && echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
   && sudo apt update \
   && sudo apt install gh -y
   ```

3. Authenticate with GitHub CLI to cache credentials:

   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

   - Select **HTTPS** as the protocol.
   - If logging in via browser, install Firefox if needed: `snap install firefox`.

### Project Space Setup

1. Clone the repository using HTTPS:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rage/secret-project-331.git
   ```

2. Run the `vdi-setup` script to install required dependencies and set up the project in your `/data` drive:

   ```bash
   cd secret-project-331
   sudo bin/vdi-setup
   ```

3. Apply any environment variable changes:

   ```bash
   source "$HOME/.profile"
   ```

   > **Note**: If this command does not work, try running it in a Bash shell instead of Fish. Enter Bash by typing `bash`, run the command, then exit Bash with `Ctrl+D`.

4. Install the projects version of Node.js (run in secret-project-331 root):

   ```bash
   nvm install
   ```

5. Apply Docker group permissions:

   ```bash
   newgrp docker
   ```

6. Install Rust using rustup: https://rustup.rs/

7. Install required tools by running:

   ```bash
   bin/download-applications-linux
   ```

8. Restart your terminal to apply all changes.

9. Delete the initially cloned repository if you no longer need it and use the one located in `/data`.

### Running the Development Environment

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd /data/username/Code/secret-project-331
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the `docs/Development.md` file under the section **Running the development environment** to complete the setup.

> **Tip**: The `vdi-setup` script installs most dependencies, so you may skip parts of the setup process in `Development.md`.
