<p>This crate provides a variety of <code>Futures</code>-based and <code>async/await</code> compatible
types that are based on the idea of intrusive collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Channels in a variety of flavors:
<ul>
<li>Oneshot</li>
<li>Multi-Producer Multi-Consumer (MPMC)</li>
<li>State Broadcast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Synchronization Primitives:
<ul>
<li>Manual Reset Event</li>
<li>Mutex</li>
<li>Semaphore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A timer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="intrusive-collections"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#intrusive-collections">§</a>Intrusive collections?</h3>
<p>In an intrusive collection, the elements that want to get stored inside the
collection provide the means to store themselves inside the collection.
E.g. in an intrusive linked list, each element that gets stored inside the
list contains a pointer field that points to the next list element. E.g.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="comment">// The element which is intended to be stored inside an intrusive container
</span><span class="kw">struct </span>ListElement {
   data: u32,
   next: <span class="kw-2">*mut </span>ListElement,
}

<span class="comment">// The intrusive container
</span><span class="kw">struct </span>List {
    head: <span class="kw-2">*mut </span>ListElement,
}</code></pre></div>
<p>The advantage here is that the intrusive collection (here: the list) requires
only a fixed amount of memory. In this case it only needs a pointer to the
first element.</p>
<p>The list container itself has a fixed size of a single pointer independent
of the number of stored elements.</p>
<p>Intrusive lists are often used in low-level code like in operating system
kernels.  E.g. they can be used for storing elements that represent threads
that are blocked and waiting on queue.  In that case the stored elements can
be on the call stack of the caller of each blocked thread, since the
call stack won’t change as long as the thread is blocked.</p>
<h4 id="application-in-futures"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#application-in-futures">§</a>Application in Futures</h4>
<p>This library brings this idea into the world of Rusts <code>Future</code>s. Due to the
addition of <code>Pin</code>ning, the address of a certain <code>Future</code> is not allowed to
change between the first call to <code>poll()</code> and when the <code>Future</code> is dropped.
This means the data inside the <code>Future</code> itself can be inserted into an
intrusive container. If the the call to <code>Future::poll()</code> is not immedately
ready, some parts of the <code>Future</code> itself are registered in the type which
yielded the <code>Future</code>. Each <code>Future</code> can store a <code>Waker</code>. When the original
type becomes ready, it can iterate through the list of registered <code>Future</code>s,
wakeup associated tasks, and potentially remove them from its queue.</p>
<p>The result is that the future-yielding type is not required to copy an
arbitrary number of <code>Waker</code> objects into itself, and thereby does not require
dynamic memory for this task.</p>
<p>When a <code>Future</code> gets destructed/dropped, it must make sure to remove itself
from any collections that refer to it to avoid invalid memory accesses.</p>
<p>This library implements common synchronization primitives for the usage in
asychronous code based on this concept.</p>
<p>The implementation requires the usage of a fair chunk of <code>unsafe</code>
annotations. However the provided user-level API is intended to be fully safe.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-this-library"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#features-of-this-library">§</a>Features of this library</h3>
<p>The following types are currently implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Channels (oneshot and multi-producer-multi-consumer)</li>
<li>Synchronization primitives (async mutexes and events)</li>
<li>Timers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-goals-for-the-library"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#design-goals-for-the-library">§</a>Design goals for the library</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide implementations of common synchronization primitives in a platform
independent fashion.</li>
<li>Support <code>no-std</code> environments. As many types as possible are also provided
for <code>no-std</code> environments. The library should boost the ability to use
async Rust code in environments like:
<ul>
<li>Microcontrollers (RTOS and bare-metal)</li>
<li>Kernels</li>
<li>Drivers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid dynamic memory allocations at runtime.  After objects from this
library have been created, they should not require allocation of any
further memory at runtime.  E.g. they should not need to allocate memory
for each call to an asynchronous function or each time a new task accesses
the same object in parallel.</li>
<li>Offer familiar APIs.
The library tries to mimic the APIs of existing Rust libraries like the
standard library and <code>futures-rs</code> as closely as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-goals"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#non-goals">§</a>Non goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide IO primitives (like sockets), or platform specific implementations.</li>
<li>Reach the highest possible performance in terms of throughput and latency.
While code in this library is optimized for performance, portability
and deterministic memory usage are more important goals.</li>
<li>Provide future wrappers for platform-specific APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="local-non-local-and-shared-flavors"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#local-non-local-and-shared-flavors">§</a>Local, Non-local and shared flavors</h3>
<p>The library provides types in a variety of flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A local flavor (e.g. <a href="channel/type.LocalChannel.html" title="type futures_intrusive::channel::LocalChannel"><code>channel::LocalChannel</code></a>)</li>
<li>A non-local flavor (e.g. <a href="channel/type.Channel.html" title="type futures_intrusive::channel::Channel"><code>channel::Channel</code></a>)</li>
<li>A shared flavor (e.g. <a href="channel/shared/type.Sender.html" title="type futures_intrusive::channel::shared::Sender"><code>channel::shared::Sender</code></a>)</li>
<li>A generic flavor (e.g. <a href="channel/struct.GenericChannel.html" title="struct futures_intrusive::channel::GenericChannel"><code>channel::GenericChannel</code></a> and
<a href="channel/shared/struct.GenericSender.html" title="struct futures_intrusive::channel::shared::GenericSender"><code>channel::shared::GenericSender</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between these types lie in their thread-safety. The non-local
flavors of types can be accessed from multiple threads (and thereby also
futures tasks) concurrently. This means they implement the <code>Sync</code> trait in
addition to the <code>Send</code> trait.
The local flavors only implement the <code>Send</code> trait.</p>
<h4 id="local-flavor"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#local-flavor">§</a>Local flavor</h4>
<p>The local flavors will require no internal synchronization (e.g. internal
Mutexes) and can therefore be provided for all platforms (including <code>no-std</code>).
Due the lack of required synchronization, they are also very fast.</p>
<p>It might seem counter-intuitive to provide synchronization primitives that
only work within a single task. However there are a variety of applications
where these can be used to coordinate sub-tasks (futures that are polled on
a single task concurrently).</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates this use-case:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">async fn </span>async_fn() {
    <span class="kw">let </span>event = LocalManualResetEvent::new(<span class="bool-val">false</span>);
    <span class="kw">let </span>task_a = <span class="kw">async </span>{
        <span class="comment">// Wait for the event
        </span>event.wait().<span class="kw">await</span>;
        <span class="comment">// Do something with the knowledge that task_b reached a certain state
    </span>};
    <span class="kw">let </span>task_b = <span class="kw">async </span>{
        <span class="comment">// Some complex asynchronous workflow here
        // ...
        // Signal task_a
        </span>event.set();
    };
    <span class="macro">join!</span>(task_a, task_b);
}</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="non-local-flavor"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#non-local-flavor">§</a>Non-local flavor</h4>
<p>The non-local flavors can be used between arbitrary tasks and threads.  They
use internal synchronization for this in form of an embedded <code>Mutex</code> of
<a href="../parking_lot/mutex/type.Mutex.html" title="type parking_lot::mutex::Mutex"><code>parking_lot::Mutex</code></a> type.</p>
<p>The non-local flavors are only available in <code>alloc</code> environments.</p>
<h4 id="shared-flavor"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#shared-flavor">§</a>Shared flavor</h4>
<p>For some types a shared flavor is provided. Non-local flavors of types are
<code>Sync</code>, but they still can only be shared by reference between various tasks.
Shared flavors are also <code>Sync</code>, but the types additionally implement the
<code>Clone</code> trait, which allows duplicating the object, and passing ownership of
it to a different task. These types allow avoiding references (and thereby
lifetimes) in some scenarios, which makes them more convenient to use.  The
types also return <code>Future</code>s which do not have an associated lifetime.  This
allows using those types as implementations of traits without the need for
generic associated types (GATs).</p>
<p>Due to the requirement of atomic reference counting, these types are
currently only available for <code>alloc</code> environments.</p>
<h4 id="generic-flavor"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#generic-flavor">§</a>Generic flavor</h4>
<p>The generic flavors of provided types are parameterized around a
<a href="../lock_api/mutex/trait.RawMutex.html" title="trait lock_api::mutex::RawMutex"><code>lock_api::RawMutex</code></a> type. These form the base for the non-local and shared
flavors which simply parameterize the generic flavor in either a
non-thread-safe or thread-safe fashion.</p>
<p>Users can directly use the generic flavors to adapt the provided thread-safe
types for use in <code>no-std</code> environments.</p>
<p>E.g. by providing a custom <a href="../lock_api/mutex/trait.RawMutex.html" title="trait lock_api::mutex::RawMutex"><code>lock_api::RawMutex</code></a>
implementation, the following platforms can be supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>For RTOS platforms, RTOS-specific mutexes can be wrapped.</li>
<li>For kernel development, spinlock based mutexes can be created.</li>
<li>For embedded development, mutexes which just disable interrupts can be
utilized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relation-to-types-in-other-libraries"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#relation-to-types-in-other-libraries">§</a>Relation to types in other libraries</h3>
<p>Other libraries (e.g. <code>futures-rs</code> and <code>tokio</code>) provide many primitives that
are comparable feature-wise to the types in this library.</p>
<p>The most important differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>This library has a bigger focus on <code>no-std</code> environments, and does not
only try to provide an implementation for <code>alloc</code> or <code>std</code>.</li>
<li>The types in this library do not require dynamic memory allocation for
waking up an arbitrary number of tasks waiting on a particular
<code>Future</code>. Other libraries typically require heap-allocated nodes of
growing vectors for handling a varying number of tasks.</li>
<li>The <code>Future</code>s produced by this library are all <code>!Unpin</code>, which might make
them less ergonomic to use.</li>
</ul>
