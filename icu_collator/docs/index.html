<h2 id="design-notes"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#design-notes">§</a>Design notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The collation element design comes from ICU4C. Some parts of the ICU4C design, notably,
<code>Tag::BuilderDataTag</code>, <code>Tag::LeadSurrogateTag</code>, <code>Tag::LatinExpansionTag</code>, <code>Tag::U0000Tag</code>,
and <code>Tag::HangulTag</code> are unused.
<ul>
<li><code>Tag::LatinExpansionTag</code> might be reallocated to search expansions for archaic jamo
in the future.</li>
<li><code>Tag::HangulTag</code> might be reallocated to compressed hanja expansions in the future.
See <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/issues/1315">issue 1315</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The key design difference between ICU4C and ICU4X is that ICU4C puts the canonical
closure in the data (larger data) to enable lookup directly by precomposed characters
while ICU4X always omits the canonical closure and always normalizes to NFD on the fly.</li>
<li>Compared to ICU4C, normalization cannot be turned off. There also isn’t a separate
“Fast Latin” mode.</li>
<li>The normalization is fused into the collation element lookup algorithm to optimize the
case where an input character decomposes into two BMP characters: a base letter and a
diacritic.
<ul>
<li>To optimize away a trie lookup when the combining diacritic doesn’t contract,
there is a linear lookup table for the combining diacritics block. Three languages
tailor diacritics: Ewe, Lithuanian, and Vietnamese. Vietnamese and Ewe load an
alternative table. The Lithuanian special cases are hard-coded and activatable by
a metadata bit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, contractions that contract starters don’t fit this model nicely. Therefore,
there’s duplicated normalization code for normalizing the lookahead for contractions.
This code can, in principle, do duplicative work, but it shouldn’t be excessive with
real-world inputs.</li>
<li>As a result, in terms of code provenance, the algorithms come from ICU4C, except the
normalization part of the code is novel to ICU4X, and the contraction code is custom
to ICU4X despite being informed by ICU4C.</li>
<li>The way input characters are iterated over and resulting collation elements are
buffered is novel to ICU4X.</li>
<li>ICU4C can iterate backwards but ICU4X cannot. ICU4X keeps a buffer of the two most
recent characters for handling prefixes. As of CLDR 40, there were only two kinds
of prefixes: a single starter and a starter followed by a kana voicing mark.</li>
<li>ICU4C sorts unpaired surrogates in their lexical order. ICU4X operates on Unicode
<a href="https://unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value">scalar values</a> (any Unicode
code point except high-surrogate and low-surrogate code points), so unpaired
surrogates sort as REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs. Therefore, all unpaired
surrogates are equal with each other.</li>
<li>Skipping over a bit-identical prefix and then going back over “backward-unsafe”
characters is currently unimplemented but isn’t architecturally precluded.</li>
<li>Hangul is handled specially:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Precomposed syllables are checked for as the first step of processing an
incoming character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual jamo are lookup up from a linear table instead of a trie. Unlike
in ICU4C, this table covers the whole Unicode block whereas in ICU4C it covers
only modern jamo for use in decomposing the precomposed syllables. The point
is that search collations have a lot of duplicative (across multiple search)
collations data for making archaic jamo searchable by modern jamo.
Unfortunately, the shareable part isn’t currently actually shareable, because
the tailored CE32s refer to the expansions table in each collation. To make
them truly shareable, the archaic jamo expansions need to become self-contained
the way Latin mini expansions in ICU4C are self-contained.</p>
<p>One possible alternative to loading a different table for “search” would be
performing the mapping of archaic jamo to the modern approximations as a
special preprocessing step for the incoming characters, which would allow
the lookup of the resulting modern jamo from the normal root jamo table.</p>
<p>“searchjl” is even more problematic than “search”, since “searchjl” uses
prefixes matches with jamo, and currently Hangul is assumed not to participate
in prefix or contraction matching.</p>

<h2 id="notes-about-index-generation"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#notes-about-index-generation">§</a>Notes about index generation</h2>
<p>ICU4X currently does not have code or data for generating <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#Collation_Indexes">collation
indexes</a>.</p>
<p>On the data side, ICU4X doesn’t have data for <code>&lt;exemplarCharacters type=&quot;index&quot;&gt;</code>
(or when that’s missing, plain <code>&lt;exemplarCharacters&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Of the collations, <code>zh-u-co-pinyin</code>, <code>zh-u-co-stroke</code>, <code>zh-u-co-zhuyin</code>, and
<code>*-u-co-unihan</code> are special: They bake a contraction of U+FDD0 and an index
character in the collation order. ICU4X collation data already includes this.
For <code>*-u-co-unihan</code> this index character data is repeated in all three tailorings
instead of being in the root. If it was in the root, code for extracting the
index characters from the collation data would need to avoid confusing the
<code>unihan</code> index contractions (if they were in the root) and the <code>zh-u-co-pinyin</code>,
<code>zh-u-co-stroke</code>, and <code>zh-u-co-zhuyin</code> in the tailoring. This seems feasible,
but isn’t how CLDR and ICU4C do it. (If the index characters for
<code>*-u-co-unihan</code> were in the root, <code>ko-u-co-unihan</code> would become a mere
script reordering.)</p>
<p>It’s unclear how useful it would be size-wise to have code to extract the
index characters from the collations: For <code>zh-u-co-pinyin</code>, <code>zh-u-co-stroke</code>,
<code>zh-u-co-zhuyin</code>, the index characters are contiguous ranges that could be
efficiently stored as start and end. Moreover, the in-data index character
for <code>stroke</code> isn’t the label to be rendered to the user, so special-casing
is needed anyway.</p>
<p>This means that there’s a tradeoff between having duplicate data (relative to
the collation tailorings) for the <code>unihan</code> index character list vs. having
code for extracting the list from the tailorings. It’s not at all clear that
having the code is better for size than having the list of 238 ideographs
itself as data (476 bytes as UTF-16).</p>
