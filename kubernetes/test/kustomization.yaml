# The test environment is supposed to match the production environment as much as possible.
# The only difference is that it's supposed to run on local machines and on continous integration servers.
# Thats why we add PostgreSQL and ease the resource limitations a bit.

resources:
  - ../production
  # Test mode uses the same db server as dev so that the dev db is availabe for type checking while the test environment is running. The test environment uses a different databases ('headless_lms_test') in the same postgres.
