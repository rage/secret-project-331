# In this dockerfile, we build a production base image that is intended to be much smaller than the development base image. This is done to ensure we can get the production images running without requiring multi-gigabyte image downloads.
# You can rebuild this image by running bin/build-dockerfile-production-base in the repo root

# We use the development image as a source
