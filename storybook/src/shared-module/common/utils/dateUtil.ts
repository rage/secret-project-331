 * Make timezone errors less likely in date strings. If time is not specified, sets the time to the middle of day so that the date is less likely to change if some system assumes the time is in a wrong timezone.
 *
 * The case that this is preventing may something like this:
 * 1. The user inputs only the date (without time), e.g. "2023-01-01"
 * 2. Parsing the date defaults the time to 0, e.g. "2023-01-01T00:00:00"
 * 3. Some system that may or may not control by us assumes the timestamp is in a timezone that was not intended and substracts some hours from the timestamp. Suddenly the completion date is not 2023-01-01 anymore.
 *
 * The fix is to default the time to the middle of the day.
 *
 * @param dateString Date in a string format.
 * @returns Modified date string
